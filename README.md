This program will contribute to a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. 

This program will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure.

## Concepts
Domain Modeling
The solution was realised by modeling a number of user stories from our client. Paying close attention to the desired behaviour of our users was key to the success of the project.

## TDD
Everything in our solution has been test driven, to ensure our code is well designed and easily maintainable.

## Pair Programming
Pairing allowed difficult problems to be solved at twice the speed.
